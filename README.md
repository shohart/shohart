### 🙋‍♂️ Hello there!

My name is Aleksei and I am a passionate learner who recently started delving into the world of Python, SQL, and data science. I have a strong interest in big data and machine learning concepts, and I am always eager to learn new things and expand my skillset adn to apply these skills in real-world projects.

In my previous career, I had experience managing a team of up to 6 people and successfully handling complex tasks and challenges. My goal is to become a senior project manager or team leader in an interesting and innovative project that involves working with big data to help people.

I am open-minded and always ready to take on new challenges. At the age of 36, I am excited to embark on a successful career in this field and am excited to see where it takes me.
